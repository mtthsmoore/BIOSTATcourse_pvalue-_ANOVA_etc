# D012513

To run the course as a Jupyter notebook you need to install the Anaconda software:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

You will need the Python 2.7 version.

Clone the repository (or download it as a .zip file and uncompress) to a folder on your computer (let's say c:\D012513).

After installing Anaconda you need to open the Anaconda Prompt (Windows only) and go to the folder where you have the course (e.g. c:\D012513).
When you type

$ jupyter notebook

your browser will be started and listing of the notebooks in the course will be shown.
You can open a notebook (notebook.ipynb) by clinking on the link.
